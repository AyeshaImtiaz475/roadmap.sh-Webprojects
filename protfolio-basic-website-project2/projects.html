            <h2>Client Testimonials Slider</h2>
            <p>In this project, you will learn how to build a testimonial slider using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We use a timer to change the sliders automatically and also we have added a bountiful animation showing the slides.In this project i had used the es+6 advanced topics like setTimeout() to fixed the time for the slides to move back and forth.</p>

            <h2>Stone Paper Scissors Game</h2>
            <p>In this project, our aim is to build a modern tip calculator. The project's primary interface comprises a container labeled "Tip Calculator" with two input fields: one for the bill amount and the other for the tip percentage. The tip calculator has a modern design that is styled using CSS. We utilized JavaScript to obtain the values of the two input fields and calculate the total amount based on these values.</p>

            <h2>Dice Roll Simulator </h2>
            <p>In this project, we are going to create an age calculator. As you can see from the final version of the project, we have a container here with the title age calculator with an input of a date. If we click on the date input, we can choose the date of our birthday. For example, if we choose a date in in 2022 and if we click now on Calculate Age, you can see the age is calculated based on this date and saying your age is 21 years old.</p>

            <h2>Pomodoro Timer</h2>
            <p>The objective of this project is to design a Pomodoro timer that features a countdown clock and three functional buttons, namely start, stop, and reset. Upon clicking the start button, the timer will commence counting down from 25 minutes. Should one desire to halt the countdown, the stop button can be pressed. The countdown can be resumed by hitting the start button, and by clicking on the reset button, the timer will reset to 25 mins again. An alert will notify the user when the timer reaches zero. </p>

            <h2>Sidebar Menu Project </h2>
            <p>In this project, our goal is to create a sidebar menu in this project. At the top right of the website, you can find a hamburger icon. Upon clicking on it, the menu appears smoothly, featuring multiple options with a beautiful hovering effect. We'll also create a logo as an SVG image and obtain a cross icon from Font Awesome. Clicking the cross icon will close the menu.</p>

            <h2>Dark Mode Toggle Project</h2>
            <p>In this project, we'll create a toggle button that switches the website between dark and light modes, with a sliding animation for a more visually appealing transition. We'll use keyframe CSS queries to create the animation and JavaScript to change the background color dynamically. The user's preference will be stored using the browser's local storage, ensuring that their selection persists even if they refresh the page. This project will teach you advanced CSS techniques, JavaScript programming, and how to improve the user experience by storing data in the browser.</p>

            <h2>Background Video Project</h2>
            <p>In this project, we'll explore incorporating a background video for websites, featuring a title and a button to pause and play the video. We'll use Font Awesome to obtain power and play icons and obtain free background videos from the internet. Upon page refresh, a pre-loader displays before the website fully loads. We'll acquire free pre-loaders and use JavaScript to display them before the website fully loads. Once both the video and website are loaded, the pre-loader disappears.

            <h2>Weight Converter Project</h2>
            <p>The webpage features an input field where users can enter a weight in pounds, and the webpage automatically displays the equivalent weight in kilograms. After 10 seconds, the result is removed, and the input field is emptied using the 'set time out' method. We've also incorporated an error handling feature to handle negative input numbers. If the user enters a negative number, the webpage displays an error message, "Please enter a valid number." We'll learn how to handle error situations and remove the error message after two seconds using an event listener for the input field. The event listener will call a function that performs the desired actions.</p>

            <h2>Image Slider Project</h2>
            <p>For this project, our aim is to construct an image slider with a diverse range of functionalities. The final product is an image slider that will automatically shift every five seconds. In addition to this, there will be two buttons, a previous and a next button, enabling users to navigate through the images manually. The slider is visually appealing, featuring a stunning box shadow and icons sourced from Font Awesome. Our approach to creating this project will involve initially building the HTML structure, followed by styling the slider with CSS, and finally, adding functionality to the project using JavaScript.

            <h2>Basic Calculator Project</h2>
            <p>I created a sleek and modern calculator with all necessary buttons including numbers, operators, equal sign, and clear button. Type any arithmetic expression and the calculator will solve it instantly. We'll use JavaScript's 'eval' function to evaluate the expressions. Also, we'll learn to add event listeners to buttons with a for loop. Expect hovering and shadow effects inside and outside some elements to enhance the design.</p>
